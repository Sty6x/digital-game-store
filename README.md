# digital-game-store

A digital game store using Client side Routing from React Routers and Cheap Shark API to fetch their websites data so i don't have to use any assets

The Purpose of this project is just for me to get more familiar with React Routers and using the useEffect hook to fetch data for a component.

## API:

### Cheap Shark's API Doc: https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/#a2620d3f-683e-0396-61e7-3fe4d30ea376

### Barter VG's API Doc : https://github.com/bartervg/barter.vg/wiki/Get-Steam-App-(v1)

So many restrictions, im not able to fetch any data from some of the apis that i plan on using due to cors policy.
