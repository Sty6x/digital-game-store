# digital-game-store

A digital game store using Client side Routing from React Routers and Cheap Shark API to fetch their websites data so i don't have to use any assets

This is my second project using ReactJS. The Purpose of this project is for me to get more familiar with React Routers and using the useEffect hook to fetch data for a component and using multiple APIS.

You can visit the site here:  https://sty6x.github.io/digital-game-store/

## API USED:

Cheap Shark's API Doc: https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/#a2620d3f-683e-0396-61e7-3fe4d30ea376

Barter VG's API Doc : https://github.com/bartervg/barter.vg/wiki/Get-Steam-App-(v1)

Giphy's API Doc : https://developers.giphy.com/

So many restrictions, im not able to fetch any data from some of the apis that i plan on using due to cors policy.
